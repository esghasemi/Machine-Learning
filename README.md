# Mini Project 3 - Machine Learning Course

This branch contains the materials and code for Mini Project 3 of the Machine Learning course taught by Dr. Aliyari at the Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, K. N. Toosi University of Technology.

## Project Description

Mini Project 3 consists of three questions. We can choose between Question 1 and Question 2, i choose question 1:

### Question 1
- **Task**: Use the famous Iris dataset from the [link](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html).
- **Steps**:
  - Show the requested information such as mean, variance, correlation of features, and visualize them with t-SNE.
  - Implement SVM with linear and polynomial kernels of degrees 1 to 10.
  - Display the performance of polynomial kernels of different degrees using `imageio` as a GIF.
  - Implement SVM from scratch for polynomial kernels.
- **Files**:
  - `Mini_proj_3_Q1.ipynb`: Google Colab Notebook for the implementation and analysis.

### Question 2
- **Task**: Implement the paper "A Generalized Multiclass Support Vector Machine" ([GenSVM](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume17/14-526/14-526.pdf)).

### Question 3
- **Task**: Implement the paper "Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Autoencoder Neural Network" ([link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.11553)).
- **Steps**:
  - Implement the Autoencoder Neural Network as described in the paper.
  - Provide a report matching the questions asked.
- **Files**:
  - `Mini_proj_3_Q3.ipynb`: Google Colab Notebook for the implementation and report.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following files for Mini Project 3:

- `Mini_proj_3_Q1.ipynb`: Contains the implementation for Question 1.
- `Mini_proj_3_Q3.ipynb`: Contains the implementation for Question 3.

All the codes for this course are implemented in Python in the Google Colab environment. The code files for each mini project are placed in their respective branches.
