# Mini Project 2 - Machine Learning Course

This branch contains the materials and code for Mini Project 2 of the Machine Learning course taught by Dr. Aliyari at the Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, K. N. Toosi University of Technology.

## Project Description

Mini Project 2 consists of four questions:

### Question 1
- **Task**: Compare two activation functions, ReLU and sigmoid. Implement the given triangular shape using the MCCulloch-Pits model.

### Question 2
- **Task**: Use the CWRU Bearing Dataset to implement an MLP with two different loss functions and optimizers. Evaluate the performance using a confusion matrix and classification report. Compare k-fold Cross Validation and Stratified k-fold Cross Validation and implement the chosen method.
- **Files**:
  - `Mini_proj_2_Q2.ipynb`: Google Colab Notebook for the MLP implementation and comparison of cross-validation methods.

### Question 3
- **Task**: Use the Forest Cover Type dataset and the Drugs dataset to implement a decision tree. Evaluate its performance with a confusion matrix and three evaluation metrics. Compare Random Forest and AdaBoost and implement the chosen method.
- **Files**:
  - `Mini_proj_2_Q2.ipynb`: Google Colab for the Drugs dataset.

### Question 4
- **Task**: Use the Heart Disease Dataset to implement a Bayes classifier. Display results using a confusion matrix and classification report. Explain the difference between Macro and Micro in scikit-learn. Evaluate the classifier's performance by showing 5 random data points with actual and predicted values.
- **Files**:
  - `Mini_proj_2_Q4.ipynb`: Google Colabk for the Bayes classifier implementation and evaluation.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following files for Mini Project 2:

- `Mini_proj_2_Q2.ipynb`: Contains the implementation for Question 2.
- `Mini_proj_2_Q3.ipynb`: Contains the implementation for the Forest Cover Type dataset in Question 3.
- `Mini_proj_2_Q4.ipynb`: Contains the implementation for Question 4.

All the codes for this course are implemented in Python in the Google Colab environment. The code files for each mini project are placed in their respective branches.
